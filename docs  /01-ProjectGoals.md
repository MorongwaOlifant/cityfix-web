# CityFix Project Goals

## What is this app?
CityFix is a web-based reporting system for citizens in Pretoria to report local issues like service delivery, potholes, broken traffic lights, broken lights water leaks, etc.

## Why am I building this?
- To improve my software development portfolio.
- To learn how to build a fullstack app (React + JavaScript + Node + MongoDB + Next.js + Express.js).
- To potentially scale this project and pitch it to real clients or government.

## What is the user supposed to do?
- Landing Page
- Click the issue they want to report
- Fill a form: name, surname, phone, email, pload photo, choose location, describe problem
- Submit
- Get a confirmation
- Admin sees the issue and updates status

## What is my end goal?
- A fully working web app hosted online
- A clean GitHub repo and documentation
- A case study I can show in my portfolio
